Exercises
======

* [Tape equilibrium](https://codility.com/programmers/task/tape_equilibrium/):
split an array at a point which gives a minimum absolute difference of the left
and right sums.
* [Two sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/): return indices of two
numbers that add up to a given target.
* [Sum of cubes in different
  ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_%28number%29): find all integers
that can be expressed as the sum of cubes in more than one way (using integers
less than some level N, where N=1000 was given as the exercise).
* Binary tree: a few different ways to traverse a tree, for example using
`yield` (based on a StackOverflow answer
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/26952125/1243435)).

Other snippets
======

* Itertools exercises: some simple examples of `tee` and `groupby`.
* Generate binary sequences: a short-but-funky use of `itertools` to generate
paths for populating a balanced binary tree (`0`, `1`, `00`, `01`, `10`, ...).
* Linked list: build a list, remove duplicates (with and without a hash table).
