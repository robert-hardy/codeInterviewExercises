Code interview exercises
=======
This repository contains solutions for 'Codility' type interview questions.

In each directory there is a `Readme.md` which gives links to the questions
themselves.

A note about the tests
-------
Since I use TDD very much as part of the design process, all of the code has
tests of one form or another. However, the intention was not to make the
testing thorough, but rather to get through the exercises with _just enough_
testing to settle the issues I met on the way.
