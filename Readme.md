Code interview exercises

This repository contains snippets inspired by 'Codility'-type questions.

A note about the (unit) tests
-------
Since I use TDD very much as part of the design process, all of the code has
tests of one form or another. However, the intention was not to make the
testing thorough, but rather to get through the exercises with _just enough_
testing to settle the issues I met on the way.

C++ does not come with a testing framework. I choose to use
[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest). I give details in the `cpp`
directory.
